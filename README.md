# Love At First Breach – CTF Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for the Love At First Breach CTF challenges (ticket rooms) organized by TryHackMe.

## About

These challenges focus on web exploitation mainly.

The goal is not only to exploit vulnerabilities, but to understand why they exist and how to prevent them.

## Structure

Each challenge has a writeup named "name_of_the_challenge.md" and contains explanations, screenshots and how to prevent the vulnerability.

## Disclaimer

All challenges were solved in legal training environments (TryHackMe).
